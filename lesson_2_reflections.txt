What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When I initialize a repository, a new directory is created. This directory is .git
   I need to do this so Git can control what is going to be commited or not 
   inside the repository.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 A: The function of the staging area is to differentiate what is going to be commited and what is not (the latter
    will be just in the working directory).
