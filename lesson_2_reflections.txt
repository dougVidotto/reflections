What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When I initialize a repository, a new directory is created. This directory is .git
   I need to do this so Git can control what is going to be commited or not 
   inside the repository.

 How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 A: The function of the staging area is to differentiate what is going to be commited and what is not (the latter
    will be just in the working directory).

    How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

 A:	The staging area is a pre-commit area. You can use it to make sure which files are going to be commited and what are the changes
    you are doing before commiting (you can check this through git diff).
