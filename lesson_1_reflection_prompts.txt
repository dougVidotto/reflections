How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

A: Using diff helps to find bugs because you can see right away where a file
   was modified, meaning you don't have to scam the whole file looking for
   the mistake. So using diff can save you a lot of time and prevent
   lots of bugs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

A: Having easy access to the entire history of a file is good because if you don't like
   what is in your current version (maybe you have a bug that will take a long time to solve for example), you can return to previous version quickly.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

A:	Pros: You can make logic commits. You just commit code without errors
	Cons: The oposite of above. If the commit is created automatically, 
	you may have code that does not compile inside your repository. And
	also, you may have code that doesnt make sense by itself.

	The pros of automatically saving your code is that you may have a backup
	of what you just have written if something bad happens like a blackout
	or machine failure.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 A: I think Git allows saving multiple files in one commit to keep a version
 	of the system or whathever the thing you are doing. If you have a web system
 	you can keep track of all versions of it, not just single files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 A: With Git Log you can see all commits that were made in that project, when and who made
 	them. With Git Diff you can see which changes were made inside that project like which
 	lines were deleted, inserted and what was changed exactly.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

 A: Using version control makes you more confident because if you break something
 	you can restore a previous version (that was working) very quickly. And because
 	you can do that, a programmer is not afraid of making changes into the code.
